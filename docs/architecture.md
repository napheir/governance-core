# governance-core — Architecture

Multi-agent governance-as-a-package. Generic constitution clauses + hooks +
skills + audit tools packaged so any new multi-agent Claude Code project can
inherit them with `pip install governance-core` + one `governance-core
install` invocation.

## Companion repo

This package is half of a 2-piece distribution:

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| **`governance-core`** (this) | Implementation layer (pip package) — clauses + hooks + tools + skills + contracts |
| **`multi-agent-template`** | Skeleton + bootstrap CLI (cookiecutter) — generates the project directory tree |

Downstream project = skeleton (from template) + governance assets (from this package, injected at install time).

## Generic vs business boundary

The core insight: in any multi-agent project, ~65% of the governance
infrastructure is generic (proposal flow, scope enforcement, hooks for
safety, wrap-up discipline, etc.). The remaining ~35% is business-specific
(data flow contracts, business agent topology, domain rules).

This package contains only the generic part. Business specifics stay in
the downstream project. The boundary is enforced at multiple layers:

| Generic (this package) | Business (downstream project) |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `clauses/art_NN_*.md` (constitution articles) | `CLAUDE.md` business clauses (e.g., Art 6 data flow) |
| `hooks/scope-guard.py` etc. | `.claude/hooks/<business-hook>.py` (e.g., pipeline-check) |
| `skills/proposal.md` etc. | `.claude/skills/<business>.md` (e.g., generate-signals) |
| `tools/proposal_lib.py` etc. | `tools/<business>.py` (e.g., pnl_debugger.py) |
| `contracts/proposal_frontmatter_schema.md` | `contracts/<business>_contract.md` |
| `agent_rules/shared.*.txt` | `agent_rules/<agent>.allow.txt` |

## Config injection mechanism

Mixed-class tools (those whose logic is generic but data is project-specific)
read from the downstream project's `.governance/` directory at runtime:

```
<downstream-project>/.governance/
  ├── config.json           # project_name, install_root, shared_state_root,
  │                         # core_agent_name, ritual_phrase, agents[],
  │                         # upstream_branch, constitution_layout
  ├── core_keywords.json    # red-line clauses for audit +
  │                         # extra_protected_patterns for check_constitution_change
  ├── sync_files.json       # ALWAYS_COPY_FILES for sync_infra
  ├── data_source_entries.json  # prepare_dataset entry imports for data-source-guard
  └── clauses/              # rendered governance-core clauses with
                            # substitutions (e.g., ritual phrase)
      ├── art_00_ritual.md
      └── ...
```

Every tool that reads config has a fallback path: if `.governance/` files
are missing, generic empty/placeholder defaults kick in so bootstrap
doesn't deadlock. Onboarded projects always supply their own `.governance/`
(created by `governance-core install`), so fallbacks never surface in
normal operation.

Since P-0063 this also covers the three scope-security hooks/tools whose
business data was previously placeholder-substituted (which would silently
break them if consumed verbatim): `_guard_common.py` derives cross-repo
block patterns from `config.json`; `data-source-guard.py` reads
prepare_dataset entry imports from `data_source_entries.json`;
`check_constitution_change.py` appends `extra_protected_patterns` from
`core_keywords.json`.

## CLI subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `install` | First-time setup: write config.json, copy assets to .claude/, render clauses, configure .gitattributes |
| `upgrade` | Refresh assets while preserving config.json (post-`git pull` of governance-core) |
| `doctor` | Verify config + hooks + clauses present and valid |
| `render-clauses` | Standalone clause render (used by template bootstrap; useful for surgical clone updates) |
| `version` | Print package version |

## Upgrade flow

When governance-core releases a new version (new clause / fixed hook /
better tool), downstream projects upgrade independently:

```pwsh
cd ~/workshop-claude/governance-core && git pull && pip install -e . --upgrade
cd ~/workshop-claude/my-project && governance-core upgrade --project-root .
```

`upgrade` preserves `.governance/config.json` (your customizations) but
refreshes `.governance/clauses/` + `.claude/` from the new package. Business
files (top-level CLAUDE.md, business hooks, business contracts) are never
touched.

## Cross-clone coordination

For multi-clone projects (one git clone per agent), each clone needs its
own `.governance/`. Two approaches:

1. **Full install per clone** — overwrites .claude/ etc. Good for fresh projects.
2. **Surgical bootstrap** — copy config JSONs + `render-clauses` only.
   Preserves clone-specific .claude/ content. See agent-core's
   `tools/bootstrap_governance_in_clones.py` (P-0059 Phase 2.5) for the
   surgical pattern.

## Dogfood case: agent-core (Trade Agent)

The package's first production user is agent-core itself — the project
where the package was extracted from. Phase 2 of P-0059 migrated
agent-core to consume governance-core, validating:

- `pip install -e ../governance-core` works from agent-core
- `.governance/config.json` with Trade Agent topology (5 agents,
  ritual=`如君所愿`) loaded by `load_config('.')`
- 17 clauses rendered with `如君所愿` substituted
- `audit_sub_constitutions`, `sync_infra`, `regen_constitution`,
  `migrate_proposals_to_shared_state` all read from `.governance/` with
  fallback
- `constitution/total.md` slim from 625 → 450 lines; CLAUDE.md 21459 →
  15322 chars (-28%)
- 10/10 regression tests pass (see agent-core
  `tests/regression/test_governance_dogfood.py`)

P-0059 Phase 2 only migrated config + clauses + a slim CLAUDE.md — agent-core
still kept its own copies of the generic hooks/tools. P-0063 closed that gap:
governance-core's copies were reconciled to the single authoritative version
(config-driven + sanitized), then agent-core adopted them via
`governance-core upgrade`. agent-core is now a *true* consumer — its generic
hooks/tools/skills are install-managed (refreshed by `upgrade`, never
hand-edited), so improving a common-layer capability means editing the
governance-core repo, not a local copy.

## Dogfood case: governance-core itself (self-hosting)

Since P-0066, `governance-core` is also its **own** consumer. The repo was
onboarded as a single-core-agent governed project: `governance-core install`
self-installs the governance layer into the repo, so changes to the package
are now made *in governance-core's own Claude Code session, in-boundary* —
no more cross-boundary reach-in from another project.

The "repo ⊃ package" split keeps source and self-installed instance distinct:

| | Path | git |
|--|------|-----|
| Package **source** (authoritative) | `governance_core/` | committed |
| **Autonomy layer** (self-installed instance — pure derivative) | root `.claude/{hooks,skills,commands,agents}/`, `tools/`, `contracts/`, `agent_rules/`, `knowledge/`, `.governance/clauses/` | **gitignored** |
| Runtime state | `shared_state/` (in-flight proposals) | gitignored |
| Authored config / constitution | `.governance/config.json`, `.role`, `constitution/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json` | committed |

The autonomy layer is gitignored because, for a single-repo single-agent
project, install artifacts are pure derivatives (`governance-core install`
regenerates them) with no other clone to propagate to — committing them would
be committing `dist/`. A fresh clone runs `governance-core install
--project-root .` to materialize the layer. The pip build is unaffected:
`packages.find` is limited to `governance_core*`, so wheel + sdist never
contain the autonomy layer.

The dogfood loop: edit `governance_core/` → `governance-core upgrade
--project-root .` → test. Because the installer is copy-based, the autonomy
layer is a snapshot — a source change is only exercised after the reinstall.
See `docs/core-manual.md` for the operations manual and
`constitution/total.md` 第十一条 for the governing clause.

## Config-aware skills (single-agent degradation)

P-0066 made the constitution *clauses* topology-aware (multi-agent articles
degrade for a single-agent project) but left the *skills* as their original
multi-agent versions — so `/wrap-up`, the skill Art.14 mandates, was
~half-inapplicable to self-hosted governance-core. P-0068 closed that gap
under one principle: **install-and-get-everything** — the package always
ships the complete capability set; a consumer's topology
(`.governance/config.json` `agents` count) changes only which steps *run*,
never which capabilities are *present*.

Each shipped skill step is one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| **A — broken path** | Hardcoded cross-repo references (`../agent-core`, absolute paths) — de-hardcoded; a bug in any topology. |
| **B — genuinely multi-agent** | Cross-clone / cross-agent steps — under single-agent topology they degrade to **not-run** (an explicit `[N/A — single-agent topology — skipped]`). The multi-agent capability stays fully shipped. |
| **C — runs single-agent too** | Lesson classification, skill extraction, STATE.md — **fixed so they run**, not skipped: the existing decision logic is reused verbatim, only topology-dependent edges (paths, git treatment) adapt. |

The skill-learning machinery (`skills.discovery`) was found unpackaged and
spun out to P-0069; until it lands, `/extract-skill` + `/wrap-up` Steps
4a–4c are capability-gated (skip cleanly). The installer also seeds an
initial `STATE.md` and emits `.claude/settings.local.json` — registering
every shipped hook from `hooks/hooks_manifest.json` (P-0067) — so a
consumer's hooks are wired on install, with no hand-authoring.

## Releasing

Both `governance-core` and `multi-agent-bootstrap` publish to PyPI via
**Trusted Publisher** (OIDC) — no API tokens. Each repo has
`.github/workflows/release.yml`:

- **GitHub Release published** -> build + publish to production PyPI
  (`environment: pypi`).
- **workflow_dispatch** (manual) -> build + publish to TestPyPI
  (`environment: testpypi`, `skip-existing`) — a rehearsal run.

To cut a release: bump the version in `pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py`,
commit, then draft & publish a GitHub Release — the workflow does the
rest. The local `twine` + `~/.pypirc` path remains as an emergency
fallback. Introduced by P-0064.
